# IndigoSDK

Indigo includes a Python-based API and object model for integrating 3rd party hardware, applications, and services into 
the Indigo Server. Indigo Plugins allow new native devices, triggers, and actions to be added directly to Indigo. The 
latest [extensive technical documentation](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/documents#technical_documents) is available online, including:

- [Indigo Scripting Tutorial](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/plugin_scripting_tutorial) - dive into scripting Indigo by examples.
- [Indigo 2024.1 Plugin Developer's Guide](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/plugin_guide) - how to create plugin bundles for easy distribution, plugin UI, APIs, 
  callback hooks, and more.
- [Indigo Object Model Reference](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/object_model_reference) - the Indigo Object Model (IOM) and how to use it in Python.

**Plugins Examples**
Several Indigo Plugin examples are included in this SDK. These examples include the full python source code and XML 
files. To see all the source files once downloaded to your Mac, right-click (or control-click) on the plugin bundle 
(.indigoPlugin file) and select **Show Package Contents** menu item. The [Plugin Developer's Guide](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/plugin_guide) has thorough 
documentation on how each file is used.

**IMPORTANT:** Although these example plugins are great templates to start with, and we encourage you to copy them, 
you must edit the **Info.plist** file inside the bundle after you make a copy for your plugin. Inside the 
**Info.plist** XML file you must give the plugin a unique identifier, called the `CFBundleIndentifier`. And you should 
also change your plugin's display name (`CFBundleDisplayName`) and help URL (`CFBundleURLTypes`). See the 
[Info.plist section of the Developer's Guide](https://www.indigodomo.com/docs/plugin_guide#the_infoplist_file) for additional details.
