        This handler is used to generate a simple api that returns device details for the specified device id. We lifted
        this example from the HTTP Responder plugin, but rather than return an HTML page, we'll just return an
        indigo.Dict to the caller for the device.

        We will also illustrate a pattern you can use for validating actions, both actions called as an API and actions
        configured and called through the UI. Historically, all validation has been done in the validate*ConfigUI
        methods, but for actions which can also be called from scripts or other plugins, that will not suffice since
        they construct their own properties to pass to the action and those aren't passed through the validate methods.
        It is also possible that the conditions will change at runtime from when the user configured the action - the
        most obvious scenario is if the user specifies substitution patterns in the action config. Since those values
        will most often change between the time the action was configured and the time the action runs, it's usually
        prudent to validate just before the action runs.

        The first part is the ID of a device and the extension as the type of content to return. We only do XML and JSON
        in this example. There is an optional arg to return JSON that doesn't have indents, which means it would be
        smaller. condense-json can be any value at all and it will skip the formatting with indents.
